pyugrid uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to pyugrid. But it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the pyugrid source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire pyugrid Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the pyugrid repositories.

The pyugrid Development Team is the set of all contributors to the pyugrid project. A full list can be obtained from the git version control logs.
